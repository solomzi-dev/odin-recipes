    <h1>Grilled Greek Chicken Breasts with Whipped Feta</h1>

        I'm showing you my favorite marinade and grilling technique for boneless, skinless chicken breasts, which can be a challenge, since they're often so dry and bland, but not with this method.
    </h3>
    <p>
        Just because I almost never grill boneless, skinless chicken breasts doesn't mean I shouldn't still want to teach those who do the best way to do it, which is why I'm posting this video for grilled Greek chicken breasts with whipped feta. That's the official reason. The real, actual reason is that I was looking for an excuse to consume large quantities of whipped feta, also known as my new favorite thing to eat.

        In fact, even if you never make the chicken part of this recipe, which you should, since it's really, really good, but even if you don't, please promise me you'll make a nice big batch of whipped feta to serve on, or with… everything. And I mean that literally. This simple spread/dip/condiment would be fantastic with anything off of the grill this summer, since cool and tangy always pairs perfectly with hot and smoky.
